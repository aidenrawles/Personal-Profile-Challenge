# Personal-Profile-Challenge

CSESoc 2023 Trainee Technical Challenge.

This webpage is mobile friendly! However, I recommend viewing on a bigger screen.

## Details

- Must be a personal profile
- Built using HTML/CSS
- Must incorporate the theme "Circles"

## Theme

I've incorporated circular objects where I can, particularly, I've integrated circles into the icons as well as buttons. I've also taken inspiration from CSEsoc's Circles colour theme which is purple. However, I couldn't really get the font used in circles, so I decided to use my own selected font.

Things I integrated from the CSESoc circles:

- Colour theme
- Purple Selection
- Round and responsive buttons

Things I thought matched the theme:

- Circular grids to showcase gallery
- Circular borders on hover

## Upcoming Features

- Dark Mode
- Swiper to showcase photos/projects

## Inspiration / Credit

I've followed some tutorials on youtube as this was my first web dev/web design project. I needed help with the styling aspect so I had to follow certain styling layout structures from youtube.
