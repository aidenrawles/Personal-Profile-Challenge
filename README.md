# Personal-Profile-Challenge
CSESoc 2023 Trainee Technical Challenge
## Details
- Must be a personal profile
- Built using HTML/CSS
- Must incorporate the theme "Circles"

## Theme
I've incorporated circular objects where I can, particularly, I've integrated circles into the icons as well as buttons. I've also taken inspiration from CSEsoc's Circles colour theme which is purple. However, I couldn't really get the font used in circles, so I decided to use my own selected font.

## Other
I've followed some tutorials on youtube as this was my first web dev/web design project. I needed help with the styling aspect so I had to follow certain styling layout structures from youtube.
